I started using Wordpress to design my blog because I like the all the free stuff I got out of the box. It is definitely the best turn-key blogging software solution out there -- at least it was when I set up my site a year or so ago. What I really liked about Wordpress was the plethora of nice looking, free themes out there. It was really easy to set up a cool looking blog in just a few minutes. 

Nowadays I think that all the Wordpress provides is probably overkill for my little blog here. What I want now is simplicity. And I found that with Jekyll. Jekyll is not a blogging software solution like Wordpress. It's a  static HTML generator that allows me to write my posts in textile or markdown, and I can check my code in at GitHub. It's a workflow I am used to. Super simple. Very clean. I like it.
