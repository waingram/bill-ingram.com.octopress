I just discovered, after months of [RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/ "JetBrains RubyMine") use, that the GoTo functions work like fuzzyfinder in Textmate. There are a lot of useful shortcuts under the GoTo menu; the ones I am finding most useful are `Ctrl+Shft+N` for finding and opening a file, `Ctrl+N` for a class, and `Alt+Shft+N` for jumping to a corresponding Rails object. For instance, if I am in the People controller, I can jump to the Person model, People views, etc, bringing me that much closer to fulfilling my dream of never having to leave the keyboard when developing.
